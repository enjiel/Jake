GO can be used with the following input: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN

With most other commands, just specify what it is you want to interact with.

HIT will attempt to hit the target with an equipped weapon.
DEFEND is used alone and will attempt to reduce incoming damage
Cast must be used with a wand and requires a spell
